## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #609 [Medium]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a node in a binary search tree, return the next bigger element, also known as the inorder successor.

For example, the inorder successor of 22 is 30.

       10
      /  \
     5    30
         /  \
       22    35

You can assume each node has a parent pointer.
