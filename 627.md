## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #627 [Medium]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

Given an iterator with methods next() and hasNext(), create a wrapper iterator, PeekableInterface, which also implements peek(). peek shows the next element that would be returned on next().

Here is the interface:

```
class PeekableInterface(object):
    def __init__(self, iterator):
        pass

    def peek(self):
        pass

    def next(self):
        pass

    def hasNext(self):
        pass
```
