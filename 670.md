## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #670 [Medium]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a positive integer n, find the smallest number of squared integers which sum to n.

For example, given n = 13, return 2 since 13 = 32 + 22 = 9 + 4.

Given n = 27, return 3 since 27 = 32 + 32 + 32 = 9 + 9 + 9.
